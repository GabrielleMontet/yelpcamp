# Yelpcamp
YelpCamp project from the Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy by Colt Steele (code-along project) - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/?src=sac&kw=the+web+developer
## Description
Full-stack application which allows users to view campgrounds in the US. Users can register, then log in and add reviews to campgrounds, and create new campgrounds. Authorization has also been added so that only the user who created the campground or the review can delete that campground or that review.
